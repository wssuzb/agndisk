- thin disk model, [Shakura & Sunyeav 1973](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1973A%26A....24..337S/abstract).
- line-driven wind model, [Laor et al., 2014](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2014MNRAS.438.3024L/abstract).

- TODO:
  - ~~X-ray reprocessing model and then lightcurves generation.~~ FINISHED!!!
  - Julia and Python version.
  - ~~Relativistic corrections, see Kato+08, p150.~~ FINISHED!!!
  
- NOTE: the code is still rudimentary for now, and the paper is in preparation (Su et al., 2023).
